# Corons_invation


Corona Invation is a replica of the famous Space Invader, with a twist. In the game, you impersonate the Unites States, and you will have to beat the coronavirus by shooting syringes or vaccines (depending on your imagination.) Darlington a young developer had an idea to replicate the old Space Invader game and now here is his version of it called Corona Invation.
